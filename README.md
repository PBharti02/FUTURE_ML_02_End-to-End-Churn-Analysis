Churn Analysis & Prediction – Telecom(Power BI+ML)
-
A data-driven Power BI solution that visualizes churn patterns and predicts customer churn for telecom businesses.


Purpose
-
-  In today’s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and this is exactly what my project does.

Business Impact & Insights:
-
Various parts of the telecom sector can utilize the dashboard to retain more customers and make the business more profitable:
Financial Impact: They see the Total Churn Rate (27.0%) and the Total Revenue of Predicted Churners ($\$42,603.54$). This guides resource allocation, showing the financial priority of retention efforts vs. acquisition.
Campaigns & Targeting: Targeted Campaigns: They use the prediction data to identify the 378 at-risk customers and their demographics (mostly Month-to-month, Credit Card payment). This allows them to craft personalized, high-value offers (e.g., contract upgrades, loyalty discounts) instead of mass marketing.
Product & Service Team: Feature Adoption & ImprovementValue Gaps: They see that customers without a Device Protection Plan churn at 71.0%. This suggests the plan is a key retention feature. They can investigate why adoption is low and work to improve the feature or its promotion.
